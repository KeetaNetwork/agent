# Keeta Agent
Keeta Agent is an automated key managemnt app for SSH and GPG keys in the macOS Secure Enclave. The Keeta Agent uniquely links `git` commits signed on a phyiscal device to the Github account, increasing security far beyond any exisitng tools. It is inspired by the [secretive project](https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive) and [sekey project](https://github.com/sekey/sekey), but rewrote and expanded to support unique key types such as GPG.
