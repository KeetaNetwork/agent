# Keeta Agent
Keeta Agent is a helper app that lives in your toolbar for automated key management of SSH and GPG keys in the macOS Secure Enclave. Keeta Agent uniquely links `git` commits signed on your physical device to your connected GitHub account, increasing developer security beyond existing tools. The [secretive project](https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive) and [sekey project](https://github.com/sekey/sekey) inspired our work on Keeta Agent but were rewritten and expanded to support unique key types such as GPG.

## Keeta Agent Benefits

### More Secure Storage

When it comes to setting up GPG or SSH keys, most people simply save them on their computer's hard drive while ensuring that they are protected by proper permissions. Although this method works in most cases, it is not completely secure as it's possible for malicious users or malware to copy your private key. However, if you store your keys in the Secure Enclave, it becomes nearly impossible to export them, thanks to the design of the Secure Enclave.

### Access Control

The Keeta Agent is specifically designed for Macs with Apple Silicon, featuring a built-in Secure Enclave that provides advanced security features such as Touch ID or authentication with Apple Watch. The Keeta Agent ensures that all requested actions are securely processed by automatically requiring Touch ID authentication before proceeding.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Direct Download

You can download the latest release on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/KeetaPay/agent/releases)

### Backups and Transfers to New Devices

When you get a new Mac, you should create a new set of secrets specific to that Mac since secrets in the Secure Enclave are not exportable and cannot be backed up or transferred to a new machine.

### Control over SSH

As part of the automated management process of Keeta Agent, it will automatically use the SSH key generated by your Secure Enclave instead of the default SSH handling within macOS, impacting existing SSH key usage.
